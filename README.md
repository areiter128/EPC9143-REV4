## P33C_CE200: Simple Control Loop Implementation
**Synchronous Buck Converter in Voltage Mode Control**

**Description:**
This code example demonstrates a closed loop voltage mode control implementation for dsPIC33CK. It has specifically been developed for the Digital Power Starter Kit 3 (DPSK3) buck converter.

The board starts up the buck converter automatically when power is applied to the board, providing a regulated output voltage of 3.3V at the output of the buck converter. The startup procedure is controlled and executed by the power controller state machine (PWRLIB_BUCK) and includes an configurable startup procedure with power-on delay, ramp up period and power good delay before dropping into constant regulation mode. 
An additional fault handler (FUNLIB_FAULT_HANDLER) shuts down the power supply if the input voltage is outside the defined range of 6V to 13.8V (UVLO/OVLO) or if the output voltage is more than 0.5V out of regulation for more than 10 milliseconds. 
The most recent input and output voltage is continuously shown on the LC display of the board and is updated every 200 ms. 

The control loop is based on a digital type III compensator (3P3Z controller).
