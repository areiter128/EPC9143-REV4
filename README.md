# PWRLIB_BUCK: Single Phase Buck Converter
## State machine for voltage and average current mode control synchronous buck converter

**Description**
This group of code files are providing a generic state machine driving a single phase synchronous buck converter in voltage or average current mode control.
The code includes the state machine, which allow to have/run multiple instances in parallel in a single project. 
Hence, multiple, independent buck converters can be added and controlled wihtout having to add individual control code. 

These code files are included on 'device' level in SMPS Firmware Framework projects of Grade 0, 1 and 2.
The Buck Converter Controller Object needs to be initialized on 'task' level while the effective control loop code is generated by DCLD on 'driver' level.

Function and code integration can be reviewed in code example CE201.
