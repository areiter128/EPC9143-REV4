## EPC9143 16th Brick Non-Isolated Step Down Converter Firmware
**2-Phase Synchronous Buck Converter with Advanced Voltage Mode Control and Current Balancing**

**Description:**
This code example demonstrates a closed loop voltage mode control implementation for dsPIC33CK. It has specifically been developed for the EPC9143 Rev4.0 1/16 brick converter.

The board starts up the buck converter automatically when power is applied to the board, providing a regulated output voltage of 12 V at the output of the converter. The startup procedure is controlled and executed by the power controller state machine (PWRLIB_BUCK) and includes an configurable startup procedure with power-on delay, ramp up period and power good delay before dropping into constant regulation mode.
An additional fault handler (FUNLIB_FAULT_HANDLER) shuts down the power supply if the input voltage is outside the defined range of 18V to 72.5V (UVLO/OVLO) or if the output voltage is more than 0.5V out of regulation for more than 10 milliseconds.

The control loop is based on a digital type IV compensator (4P4Z controller).


**Operation Parameters:**
  * Input Voltage: 18 V to 72.5 V
